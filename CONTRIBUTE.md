# 🌟 Contribution Process 🌟

We greatly appreciate your interest in contributing to our project! 🎉 Here are some guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration and efficiency.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before you start contributing, we recommend creating a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) if you don’t already have one. This will allow you to receive updates on your issues and make the source code integration easier for the project team.

## 🐞 Bug Reports or Feature Requests

- Please submit any bug reports or feature requests via the [Issue Tracker]([https://github.com/bosch-aisecurity-aishield/watchtower/issues]).
- Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and observed behavior.
- For feature requests, explain what you’re trying to accomplish and why.

## 💻 Code Contributions

1. **Fork & Clone:** Fork the project to your GitHub account and clone it locally.
2. **Branch:** Create a branch for your feature, fix, or documentation.
3. **Make Changes:** Make and test your modifications in your branch.
4. **Commit:** Commit your changes, writing good, descriptive commit messages.
5. **Push:** Push your changes back to your fork on GitHub.
6. **Pull Request:** Create a new pull request from your fork’s branch to our main branch.
7. **Review:** A technical review will be done by the project team, and together we will work to ensure the contribution meets quality standards.
